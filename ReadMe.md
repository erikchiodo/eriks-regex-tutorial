# Erik's Regex Tutorial

## Description

This repo contains a separate .md file (regex_tutorial), which walks through a general overview of what regular functions are and some of their key properties. I provide a brief description for each property (under Regex Components), with some examples. 

I also tie each regex component back to a more complex example of a regular expression -- email validation expression (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/).

## Story

```md
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## AC

```md
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```
